Recent decades have showcased significant economic progress in South Asia, characterized by attributes such as over 25\% reduction in poverty rates and surge in total trade as a percentage of GDP post-1980. The development of South Asia is intricately influenced by advances in infrastructures and technology, highlighting the interconnected dynamics of socioeconomic progress, currency valuation, and fluctuating economic metrics. This study assesses the influence of exchange rate fluctuations on key economic indicators, including trade volume, foreign direct investment (FDI), and the unemployment rate. We utilize a multiple linear regression model on panel data spanning 1960-2021 for South Asian and South East Asian countries obtained from the World Bank. Furthermore, we employ the synthetic control method (SCM) to understand the impact of Nepal's period of post-Shah dynasty abolition and subsequent political instability on exchange rate fluctuations. We discover a statistically significant and negative association between exchange rates and both trade volume and FDI. Notably, our findings reveal a nonlinear dynamic between exchange rates and trade volume. Furthermore, the synthetic Nepal path plot suggests that, in the absence of a period of political instability post-2001, Nepal's exchange rate would have exhibited a steady increase, underscoring a possible negative influence of political changes and the governance on economic indicators. By integrating our findings with existing literature, we provide valuable insights with direct policy implications for South Asian economies, specifically Nepal.
